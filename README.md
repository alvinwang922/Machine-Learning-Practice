# Machine-Learning-Practice

Practice training different machine learning models using TensorFlow.

Currently includes:
1) Linear Regression Models (predicting student grades based on their two previous grades, absences, failures, and time spent studying)
2) K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (classifying cars based on its buying and maintenance price, number of doors, persons and luggage boot capacity, and safety)
