# Machine Learning Practice

Practice training different machine learning models using TensorFlow and data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Scikit learn datasets.

Currently includes:
1) Linear Regression Model (predicting student grades based on their two previous grades, absences, failures, and time spent studying)
2) K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (classifying cars based on its buying and maintenance price, number of doors, persons and luggage boot capacity, and safety)
3) Support Vector Machine (predicting whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on 30 factors such as size and texture)
4) K-Means Clustering Algorithm (classifying images of numbers from zero to nine)
